Basic chess program that runs chess in the Java console

— This game plays almost the same to how actual chess works. For the proper rules of chess see https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess. In this version En Passant & Castling do not work.

— In order to move you will be asked to provide the coordinates of the piece you'd like to move in the [Row][Column] format. See the sides of the chessboard to find which positions correlates to what row & column. If the input is invalid, you will be asked to move again.

— You will be given two different phases when it is your turn; a pick phase, and a move phase. In the pick phase, you must provide the coordinates of the piece you want to move. In the move phase, you must provide the coordinates to the place you wish you move the previously selected piece to.

  — If you are on the move phase but wish to revert back to the picking phase, input q, quit or stop.
  
— Input HELP if you ever wish to bring this menu up during a game

— Input resign or forfeit if you ever with to forfeit the game

— Do not spam incorrect inputs, you will trigger error catching and cause delay in processing
