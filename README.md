2 Player Chess program which uses JavaFX to create an interactive GUI. This project was based off of a previous product I did [here](https://github.com/Eurphus/Chess). This game plays almost the same to how actual chess works. For the proper rules of chess see https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess. In this version En Passant & Castling do not work, as well as any other technical chess moves. This code is simple, it allows a piece to be moved to anywhere valid, then checks for end of game conditions.



Developed by Peter Macdonald for a school assignment. Feel free to use this code however you would like. Don't be afraid to commit any improvements as well.
